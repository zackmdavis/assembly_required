## Assembly Required

Despite myself, I need to learn (at least some) React in order to perform better at my dayjob! Obviously I should follow-and-modify someone's tutorial to start a toy project—but _which_ tutorial?! I think if I want to make lieutenant in the Rust Evangalism Strike Force, I had better start with [Anders Pitman's one](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/rust-react-and-web-assembly/) about how to use React with WebAssembly. I remain,

Faithfully yours,

POSTSCRIPT— OK, Pitman's tutorial was great for getting set-up with WebAssembly, but it doesn't go very far. Maybe I'll look at the [official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) next?

... it looks like the official-tutorial app is Tic-Tac-Toe, and I can't follow that exactly because then I would _die of boredom_. But squares are OK, maybe we could do something else with squares??
